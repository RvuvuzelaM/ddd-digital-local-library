# Digital Local Library

# Overview

This is a project that is mean to show example how to go from description of the domain to the code with well thought discovery processes.
[We took inspiration in this ](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples/library/tree/master#domain-description).
In this project we will try to use techniques like: EventStorming, User Story Mapping, Behaviour-Driven Development, and show how it can play with Agile methodologies and DDD.

# Domain Description

The Digital-First Local Library embraces the digital era by offering a hybrid model of traditional and modern library services.
Patrons can browse an extensive online catalog of e-books and audiobooks, which can be borrowed by multiple users simultaneously, effectively eliminating waiting periods.
Physical copies of books remain available and can be reserved online by a patron for home delivery. There are no restrictions on digital holds; however, patrons are limited to five active holds for physical books.

Patrons manage their interactions through a comprehensive digital profile, which tracks both physical and digital checkouts and suggests titles based on reading history.
The digital profile provides a dashboard displaying current and past checkouts, holds, and personalized recommendations.
Patrons can maintain an ongoing list of digital checkouts, while physical books have a 30-day borrowing period with an option for home pick-up service for returns.

Subscription plans are available, offering premium access to the digital library.
For physical books, the library employs a dynamic scheduling system that alerts patrons when their reserved books are ready for delivery or need to be returned, ensuring efficient circulation.
Overdue physical books are monitored closely, and patrons with items overdue by more than a week will receive notifications and may incur a temporary suspension of borrowing privileges.

To keep the catalog current, the library accepts book donations, which, upon vetting for condition and content, are added to the collection.
Special editions, like signed copies, may be available for restricted periods or viewing upon request to preserve their condition.

The library's system distinguishes between circulating and restricted digital assets; however, restrictions are mainly for licensing reasons rather than patron type.
A book's digital instance can be added regardless of existing ISBNs in the catalog, facilitating a broader range of available titles.
This Digital-First approach aims to balance the love of traditional book reading with the convenience of modern technology, providing a seamless, integrated reading experience for all patrons.
